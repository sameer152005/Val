            It’s incredible to think how long it’s been since we first met and
            started talking. Back then, I didn’t fully realize what your presence
            would come to mean to me. But now, after all this time, I understand
            your presence isn’t just comforting; it’s something I cherish deeply.
            Looking back, I’m beyond grateful for every conversation, every moment,
            and most of all, for you. You’re truly amazing, and I appreciate you
            more than words can express. In the beginning, I wasn’t sure how we would
            connect, how we’d talk, or how you’d be. But now, after this much
            time of talking, I’ve come to realize something—you're absolutely
            amazing

            Talking to you was quickly became one of my favorite parts of the
            day. You were like a habit for me . Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile
            I always just jumped with joy after just seeing that there is a message from you . It
            feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
            conversation. And I always waited for your message as every moment every second I just missed you more and more.
            You're not just great to look at; your personality
            makes you even more special.

            Before I sometimes wished I could meet you in person, but I didn't knew 
            how to react and how and what to talk to you as I was so so shy you know hehe .
            Still, I hope that, even though we've had so many beautiful memories and good time
            you won't forget me. No matter what, I wish you a life filled with happiness,
            peace, love and everything you truly deserve my love .

            message away and will respond as soon as I can. My time is yours
            whenever you need it and I was and I will always be yours.
            I know life and my days without you will be incredibly difficult, 
            but more than anything, I just want you to be happier—happier with 
            each passing day, more than ever before. That’s my only wish for you.
